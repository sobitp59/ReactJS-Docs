//Rules of HOOKS ðŸ”¥

// Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:
// Only call Hooks at the top level. Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
// Only call Hooks from React function components. Donâ€™t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. 
// (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks â€” your own custom Hooks.

// Function component was previously known as Stateless Component
